intro = r"""\section{Hierarchy subtrees by domain}
\label{app:treewide}
For each of the 11 domains, Fig.~\ref{fig:treewide-code-review}--\ref{fig:treewide-press-releases}
below show a subtree of the certified hierarchy (Appendix~\ref{app:hierarchy}), in the same
compact, two-column layout as the single humor example in Fig.~\ref{fig:tree} above. For each
domain we pick the R3 evaluative category with the most member R2 themes and show its two
richest themes (by number of member R1 constructs); a dashed edge to an unboxed ``$\cdots$''
marks that the category has further member themes not drawn here. Each shown theme in turn
displays up to two of its richest R1 constructs (ranked by number of named L0 surface forms)
whenever the theme has at least two named constructs that each carry at least two named L0
forms; where that support does not exist, the theme instead shows only its single richest
construct, with as many named L0 forms as the data provides (2--3 where available). Nine of the
eleven domains support this two-construct branching in both shown themes (code-review,
creative-writing, grant-funding, humor, legal-outcome-prediction, math-stackexchange,
news-homepages, notice-and-comment, patents); peer-review and press-releases branch in only one
of their two shown themes, because the other theme's R1 partition is here fully degenerate
(every construct a singleton surface form) --- a genuine property of those cells, not a display
choice, and visible directly in those two panels as a theme with only one child construct. All
category, theme, and construct names are taken verbatim from the frozen taxonomies produced by
the classification pipeline of Appendix~\ref{app:hierarchy}
(\texttt{outputs/lexicon/derive\_then\_classify\_v1/<task>/\{R2,R3\}/taxonomy\_*.json}); none
are generated for this figure. Register shading and etymology/metaphoricity tags come from the
register bank (\S\ref{app:instruments}) where it covers a given surface form (shading gives
judged formality, darker $=$ more formal, and the short italic tag under a form is its dominant
etymological stratum or metaphoricity); elsewhere they are omitted rather than inferred, and the
form is drawn unshaded in plain white rather than in a color that would imply a measurement we
do not have. The machine-readable data behind every panel, including the full (untruncated)
strings, the per-theme branch-support audit, and the member-theme audit trail for each chosen R3
category, is released at \texttt{outputs/lexicon/prereg23\_task\_subtrees\_v3.json} and
\texttt{outputs/lexicon/prereg23\_r3\_names\_v3.json}.
